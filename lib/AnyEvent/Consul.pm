=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::Consul - Make async calls to Consul via AnyEvent

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent;
    use AnyEvent::Consul;
    
    my $cv = AE::cv;
    
    my $kv = AnyEvent::Consul->kv;

    # do some blocking op to discover the current index
    $kv->get("mykey", cb => sub { 
        my ($v, $meta) = @_;
    
        # now set up a long-poll to watch a key we're interested in
        $kv->get("mykey", index => $meta->index, cb => sub {
            my ($v, $meta) = @_;
            say "mykey changed to ".$v->value;
            $cv->send;
        });
    });
    
    # make the change
    $kv->put("mykey" => "newval");
    
    $cv->recv;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AnyEvent::Consul is a thin wrapper around L<Consul> to connect it to
L<AnyEvent::HTTP> for asynchronous operation.

It takes the same arguments and methods as L<Consul> itself, so see the
documentation for that module for details. The important difference is that you
must pass the C<cb> option to the endpoint methods to enable their asynchronous
mode.

There's also a C<on_error> argument. If you pass in a coderef for this
argument, it will be called with a single string arg whenever something goes
wrong internally (usually a HTTP failure). Use it to safely log or cleanup
after the error.
